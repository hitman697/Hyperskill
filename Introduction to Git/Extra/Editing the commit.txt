1. Complete a command

commit identifier

2. Name the right command

Which command should you use if you need to compare two commits?

4. What is left?

A programmer did the following steps in the following order:

changed the text in my_file.txt to "Hello world! This is my file."
added the other text file new_file.txt with the line "This is my new file"
removed my_file.txt
commited all the changes
What is left at the tip of the branch in the end?


only the new_file.txt with its text
