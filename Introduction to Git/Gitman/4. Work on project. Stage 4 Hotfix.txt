Description
While working on the newer version of the program, we can still make urgent changes to the main branch if needed. As you might remember, we had some typos in the main branch. The work on the develop branch may last a long time, so let's make a hotfix for this problem.

Objectives
Start the task by creating a new branch from the main, and name it hotfix/no-more-typos. Alter the content of the main.py file again:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Hello, world!")
When you fix the file, merge the hotfix branch to the main to have a good clean version of your code in the main branch. The commit message should be Fix typos.

Note that you should create a new branch from the main branch, not from the develop branch.

git checkout main
git branch hotfix/no-more-typos
git checkout hotfix/no-more-typos

change your main.py contents by below code:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Hello, world!")

git add .
git commit -m "Fix typos"
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/no-more-typos
