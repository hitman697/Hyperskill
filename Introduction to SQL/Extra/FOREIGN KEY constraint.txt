2. Let's see
You want to know the foreign key name in table customers. What command will you use?

SHOW CREATE TABLE customers;

3. Application

ALTER TABLE persons
ADD constraint fk_id FOREIGN KEY (id_number)

ON DELETE CASCADE;

SET NULL	Sets the foreign key in the child table to NULL.
RESTRICT	Rejects the delete or update operation for the parent table.
SET DEFAULT	Sets the foreign key in the child table to default value.

5. No more keys

CREATE TABLE schools (
 school_num INT PRIMARY KEY,

 city VARCHAR(25)
); 


CREATE TABLE students (
 first_name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, 
 last_name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, 
 school INT,
