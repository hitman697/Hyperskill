1. Circumference
Write a query that finds the circumference of a circle with a radius equal to 15.

The circumference is calculated using the formula: C = 2πR. Use π equal to 3.14.

SELECT 2 * 3.14 * 15;

2. Area of a triangle
Write a query that evaluates the area of a triangle with base 5 and height 4.

The area of a triangle is calculated using the formula: base * height / 2.

SELECT (5 * 4) / 2 AS "AREA OF A TRIANGLE";

3. Exams
John has such Math subject scores: 4, 5, 4, 4, 3, 5, 4. Find the average score by this subject.

Tip: Average score calculated as sum of all scores / quantity of scores

SELECT (4 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 5 + 4) / 7 AS "AVERAGE SCORE";

4. Expression in a query
Choose the correct pattern for evaluating an expression in SQL.

SELECT expression;

5. Discriminant
We have a quadratic equation: 45 * x^2 + 74 * x + 16 = 0

Write a query that finds the discriminant of this equation.

Discriminant formula is D = b^2 − 4 * a * c. Where a, b, c are the first, second and third equation coefficients.

SELECT  POW(74, 2) - 4 * 45 * 16 AS DISCRIMINANT;

6. Logic expression
Write a query that returns true value without using the literal TRUE.

SELECET 1;

7. Comparison
Write a query that returns true if the word "expert" precedes "expression" in lexicographical (alphabetical) order.

SELECT "expert" < "expression"

8. Query
What is the result of the query below?

SELECT (15+1)%9;

7

9. Division and remainders
Which SQL operator can be used to find the remainder of integer division?

%

10. Arithmetic operators
What arithmetic operators does SQL support?

*

-

+

/

11. Select the wrong
Select the queries where the arithmetic expressions are written wrong.

SELECT 8 // 7;

SELECT 15 == 3.6

SELECT (5 * 3) /= 5;

12. Time Lord
Convert 475200 seconds to hours using a SQL arithmetic expression.

SELECT 475200 / 3600 AS "HOUR";

13. String functions
Match these function calls with their corresponding results.

concat('ba', 'nana')		'banana'
reverse('banana')		'ananab'
substr('banana', 3, 2)		'na'
char_length('banana')		 6
replace('banana', 'n', 'l')	'balala'
