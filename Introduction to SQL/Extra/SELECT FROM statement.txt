1. After SELECT
The table "winners" has the following columns:

integer year
boolean is_winner
varchar(50) discipline
integer place (0, 1, 2)
varchar(20) first_name
varchar(20) last_name
varchar(30) nation
Consider the following query:

SELECT ? FROM winners;
What should be placed instead of a ? in order to generate the result shown below?

year	discipline				place	full_name
1948	Skating, men, single			1	Dick Button
1948	Skating, men, single			2	Hans Gerschwiler
1948	Skating, men, single			3	Edi Rada
...	...					...	...
1948	Swimming, women, 100m backstroke	3	Georges Vallerey

year, discipline, (place + 1) as "place", concat(concat(first_name, ' '), last_name) as "full_name"

2. Columns
A table is defined by the following statement:

CREATE TABLE Weather (
	day INTEGER,
	hour INTEGER,
	temperature INTEGER,
	feels_like INTEGER,
	wind_speed INTEGER,
	wind_direction VARCHAR(2),
	wind_gusts INTEGER,
	humidity DECIMAL(3,2),
	cloudiness DECIMAL(3,2),
	phenomena VARCHAR(50),
    pressure INTEGER
);
How many columns from the table "Weather" are referenced in the following query?

SELECT
    'Chicago' as place,
    day,

    feels_like < temperature as "feels colder",
    wind_speed > 7 as "windy",
    humidity,
    cloudiness
FROM

6. Weather
A table is defined by the following statement:

CREATE TABLE Weather (
    hour INTEGER,
    temperature INTEGER,
    feels_like INTEGER,

the ratio of feels_like to temperature
pressure

SELECT
    hour,
    feels_like / temperature,
    pressure
FROM 
    Weather;
