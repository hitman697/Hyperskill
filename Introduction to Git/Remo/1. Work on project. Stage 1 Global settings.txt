Description
When you install the Git utility on your system, the first thing you need to do is to define the global variables. They can be defined with a git config command followed by --global option, a variable name, and a value. This means every git repository created on your system after that will have these variables pre-defined. Below you will find a simple usage of the command. To learn more about it, you can follow the link git configuration for official documentation.

git config --global <variable name> <value>
The config command without a value will show you the value of the variable.

Objectives
Define a global variable with the name user.name and with the value hyper;

Define a global variable with the name user.email and with the value hyperskill@hyperskill.org;

Define a global variable with the name init.defaultBranch and with the value main;

Use the config command to view the user email.

Code Editor:

# Write your solution below
# You should write the commands line by line
git config --global user.name "hyper"
git config --global user.email hyperskill@hyperskill.org
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
git config --global user.email
